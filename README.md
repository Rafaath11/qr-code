## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The QR code component challenge is basic html and css project. After various trail and error i have learnt a few more css properties in the process.

Important code snippets:

```html
<div class="wrapper"></div>
```

```css
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
/* The above code is written in CSS */
```

### Continued development

Cards are quite useful in websites to showcase various projects and ideas. I'am looking forward to add cards to websites.
